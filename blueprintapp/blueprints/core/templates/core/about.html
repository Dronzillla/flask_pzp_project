                <h2>Project Context</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">In 2021, an updated Strategic Management Law of the Republic of Lithuania came into effect. The purpose of this law is to establish the principles of the strategic management system, define the levels and types of planning documents, their interrelations and impact on the planning of progress funds and continuous activity funds, determine the participants of the strategic management system, their rights and obligations, and set the governance provisions of the strategic management system.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">According to the provisions of this law, planning documents are divided into four levels: 1) state strategies, 2) strategic level planning documents, 3) programming level planning documents, and 4) activity level planning documents. When preparing programming level planning documents, one of the cornerstone documents prepared are the development programs. These are planning documents with a duration of 4â€“10 years, which specify how progress objectives will be implemented.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Primarily prepared by ministries, development programs, address significant issues and challenges within their respective areas of state activity. To tackle these problems development programs also outline planned national progress plans to be implemented. The creation of national progress plans involves assessing both financial and economic impacts. Ministries use a standardized .xlsm format spreadsheet to compile financial and economic cash flow projections and evaluate the relevant indicators for these plans.</p>
                <p>This project is a web application that enables registered and verified users to upload national progress plans. Its main purpose is to extract data from the uploaded spreadsheets, record it to database and perform visualization for both aggregate and plan specific data.</p>
